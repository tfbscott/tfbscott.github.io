<!--HELLO POTENTIAL HIRING MANAGER
Welcome to my website, please feel free to look around.
I love to learn new new things, ranging from engine architecture to
deserialization methods to website development. That is why I made this page
from scratch, to learn!
That being said, while I am very proud of what I came up with, some of the
html and css code is slightly wacky and will be updated in the future.
Technical Debt, as they say.

If you have any questions, feel free to email me at tfbscott@gmail.com

Thank you!
Scott Fado-Bristow

				<p class = "BlockText">
				
				Hello there! I am Scott Fado-Bristow, a current student at Digipen Institute of Technology studying Computer Science and Game Design.
				<br>
				I have worked on multiple student game projects with teams ranging in size from 3 to 11 people. I have taken on numerous roles including Technical Director, Producer, Build Master, Technical Designer and Tools Programmer. Each project is a new challenge and opportunity to learn. Across these projects I have explored custom engine creation, procedural content generation, animation systems, custom editors, particle systems, scripting implementation, and so much more.
				<br>
				Video Games are my passion. They can provide experiences that range from masterful art pieces that will last for hours to small, 15-minute adventures that keep you coming back to play more. It is truly a genre like no other. I look forward to working in the industry and help expand it to new heights.
				<br>
				If you have any questions or would like additional information, feel free to contact me at tfbscott@gmail.com
