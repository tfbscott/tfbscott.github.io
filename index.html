					<p class="projectText">
						Hello there! I am Scottie T. Fado-Bristow.
						<br><br>
						As a Software Engineer, I have cut my teeth on multiple live service games. I've helped prototype ideas during incubation, planned out scalable live-service systems, and helped keep the UI and Design teams affloat by creating optimized and simplified Unity UI containers.
						<br><br>
						My love for games shines, and I work amongst plushes and figures of my favorite games. I spend my week going to Fighting Game Locals, playing Pool with friends, and writting. If you ever have a few hours to kill, I will gladly pull out my documents for games and narratives and ramble to you.
						<br><br>
						If you have any questions or would like additional information, feel free to contact me at <a href="mailto:tfbscott@gmail.com">tfbscott@gmail.com</a>.
