<p class = "BlockText">On this project I acted as the lead physics programmer. Since our level consisted solely of cubes, both the level layout and collision data could be easily read in from one file. Our entire level was read into a single array that was updated in chunks. Based on the player's position, a certain number of nearby tiles were drawn. The player's collision also leveraged the row and column numbers of this array. If the player's rounded position pointed to an array index that was flagged as a tile the player was pushed back.</p>

<p class = "BlockText">
This project was my first group game project. We were a team of 3 people who were just learning about game engine architecture. While a lot of the code that makes this game run is sloppy and unoptimized, it served as a massive launching pad for every single future project I have worked on. I am proud of some of the systems I created, and would love to take the time to go back and improve upon what got me where I am today.
