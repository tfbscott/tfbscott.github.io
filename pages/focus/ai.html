					In my Junior year, I took a class on Artificial Intelligence in video games. This class extensively focused on movement behaviors, pathfinding, and decision-making. For this class's assignments, I programmed Behavior Trees, A* pathfinding, and influence maps in C++.

					During the development of P.U.P.P.I.T. I was tasked with creating the AI for the game's final boss. This was my introduction to Unrealâ€™s Behavior Tree system. While the behaviors are simple, they are enough to create an engaging experience for the player.

					For the Descent, I decided to try and create an AI that took full advantage of the Unreal Engine behavior tree. I experimented with the Environment Query System to create a movement system that would allow the enemy to jump over terrain if it assumes it would be faster. Services are used to update the enemy's pathing and perception. Blackboard-based conditions are used to abort sections of the tree if major values are changed inside the enemy's blackboard.
