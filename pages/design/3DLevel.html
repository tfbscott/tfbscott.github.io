					This project is an experiment in using spatial archetypes to guide the player in a 3D environment. The level was taken from a rough map sketched out on paper to a 3D environment that can be explored with simple controls over the course of 3 weeks.
					<br>
					The original paper prototype for this level identifies the basic layout of objects in the world and the path the player is expected to take. It also identifies the setup, hook, development, turn, and resolution phases. The next step was to create a simple boxed layout inside of Unity to make sure the planned spatial archetypes served their intended purpose. The level would receive an improvement pass twice a week. Play testing was performed at minimum 3 times a week to ensure the level was as good as it could be.

					As the weeks progressed and more feedback was received, parts of the level grew in scope. The simple descent down towards the river received small platforming puzzles and an improved environment. The fishing boats were made more numerous and people and fish were added to give the area more life. The finale was given a grand overhaul to really sell the accomplishment of finishing the level.
					<br>
					The framework the level was fixed on features a player with a semi-fixed camera. The player was controlled via tank controls and the viewport was always directly behind the player. A script controlled the angle of the viewport based on objects in front of the player. This required additional creativity with the implementation of certain areas of the level. Invisible blocks that only the camera could detect were used to raise and lower the viewport. Paths became more rigid around focal points to help guide the player. Lighting and movement were added to ensure the player wouldnâ€™t miss important objects.
